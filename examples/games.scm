;;This example is from Sterling & Shapiro, p. 214.

;;The problem reads: Three friends came first, second and
;;third in a competition.  Each had a different name, liked a
;;different sport, and had a different nationality.  Michael
;;likes basketball, and did better than the American.  Simon,
;;the Israeli, did better than the tennis player.  The
;;cricket player came first.  Who's the Australian?  What
;;sport does Richard play?
