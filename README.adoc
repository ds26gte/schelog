= Schelog

Schelog is for you if you are interested in any or all
of the following: Scheme, Prolog, logic, logic
programming, AI, and expert systems.

Schelog is an embedding of logic programming a la
Prolog in Scheme.  “Embedding” means you don’t lose
Scheme: You can use Prolog-style and conventional
Scheme code fragments alongside each other.  Schelog
contains the full repertoire of Prolog features,
including meta-logical and second-order (“set”)
predicates, leaving out only those features that could
be more easily and more efficiently done with Scheme
subexpressions.  The Schelog distribution includes
examples and comprehensive documentation.

Schelog has been tested successfully on the following
Scheme dialects:

Bigloo, Gambit, Guile, MIT Scheme, MzScheme, Petite
Chez Scheme, Pocket Scheme, SCM, and STk.
